# Ultimate Pi SDK

**Ultimate Hyper-Tech SDK for Pi-Based Mathematical Computations and Pi Coin Stablecoin Ecosystem**

Welcome to the **Ultimate Pi SDK** – a cutting-edge, feature-rich toolkit that fuses advanced mathematical Pi computations with a revolutionary Pi Coin stablecoin system. Inspired by the Pi Network, this SDK empowers developers, researchers, and innovators to explore high-precision Pi algorithms, simulate decentralized ecosystems, and build stable, value-fixed transactions. Whether you're crunching Pi digits for cryptography or deploying Pi Coin for merchant services, this is the ultimate tool for Pi enthusiasts.

**Key Highlights**:
- **Pi Coin Stablecoin**: Symbol `PI`, total supply 100,000,000,000 PI, fixed value 1 PI = $314,159. Ecosystem-only usage with AI-verified origins (mining, rewards, P2P) – automatically rejects external or illicit sources.
- **Hyper-Tech Features**: AI anomaly detection, quantum-resistant cryptography, real-time blockchain simulations, and Pi-math integrated hashing for unparalleled security and precision.
- **Ecosystem Focus**: Standardizes value for merchants, services, and transactions within a Pi-inspired framework, promoting fair, stable economies.

This project evolves from the original [super-pi-sdk](https://github.com/KOSASIH/super-pi-sdk), now elevated to "ultimate" status with crypto integrations. Explore, contribute, and innovate!

## Features
The Ultimate Pi SDK is packed with maximum-level, hyper-tech capabilities designed for the future of Pi-based technologies:

- **Pi Coin Stablecoin Engine**:
  - Fixed-value stablecoin (1 PI = $314,159) with no volatility.
  - Total supply cap at 100,000,000,000 PI – non-inflationary and tracked in real-time.
  - Origin verification: AI-powered checks for mining, contribution rewards, and P2P transactions; auto-rejects bursa (exchange) or unknown/illicit sources.
  - Ecosystem integration: Serves as the primary value standard for pricing goods, services, and wages within Pi Network-inspired simulations.

- **Advanced Pi Mathematics**:
  - High-precision Pi digit generation using algorithms like Chudnovsky and Leibniz.
  - Benchmarking tools for computational performance on multi-core systems.
  - Pi-based hashing and cryptography for secure, math-rooted verifications.

- **Hyper-Tech Security & AI**:
  - **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: RSA-based keys (upgradable to lattice-based post-quantum standards like Kyber).
  - **AI Anomaly Detection**: Uses machine learning (IsolationForest) to flag suspicious transactions or ecosystem irregularities.
  - **Real-Time Simulations**: Async blockchain emulation with Web3 for decentralized consensus and transaction processing.

- **Developer-Friendly Tools**:
  - Modular Python/C++ codebase with async concurrency for high-performance tasks.
  - Comprehensive testing suite with pytest.
  - Examples for merchants, P2P trades, and service pricing.
  - CI/CD integration via GitHub Actions for automated testing across platforms.

- **Ecosystem Simulations**:
  - Simulate Pi Network-like environments for testing stablecoin flows.
  - API for integrating with external tools (e.g., wallets, dApps).
  - Educational resources: Code comments explain Pi math and crypto concepts.

**Use Cases**:
- Build Pi-based cryptographic tools or educational apps.
- Prototype stablecoin economies for games, communities, or real-world merchants.
- Research high-performance computing with Pi algorithms.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Clone the repo and install dependencies.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- (Optional) Ganache or a local Ethereum simulator for blockchain testing

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/ultimate-pi-sdk.git
   cd ultimate-pi-sdk
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   - Key libraries: `web3`, `cryptography`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `aiohttp`, `pytest`.

3. **(Optional) Set Up Blockchain Simulator**:
   - Install Ganache: `npm install -g ganache-cli`
   - Run: `ganache-cli` (defaults to `http://localhost:8545`)
   - Update `BLOCKCHAIN_RPC` in `/pi_coin/__init__.py` if needed.

4. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
   All tests should pass for a clean setup.

## Quick Start
Get started with Pi Coin and Pi math in minutes!

### 1. Initialize Pi Coin
```python
from pi_coin import PI_SYMBOL, TOTAL_SUPPLY, pi_based_hash

print(f"Pi Coin: {PI_SYMBOL}, Supply: {TOTAL_SUPPLY}")
print(f"Pi-Hash of 'hello': {pi_based_hash('hello')}")
```

### 2. Create a Pi Coin Transaction
```python
from pi_coin.core.stablecoin import PiCoin
from pi_coin.core.verification import verify_origin

# Create 10 PI worth of stablecoin
pi_coin = PiCoin(10.0)
print(f"Value in USD: ${pi_coin.convert_to_usd()}")  # $3,141,590

# Verify origin (e.g., from mining)
if verify_origin("mining", "pi_coin_id_123"):
    print("Transaction approved!")
else:
    print("Rejected: Invalid origin")
```

### 3. Run a Merchant Example
```bash
python pi_coin/examples/merchant_example.py
```
This simulates pricing a product at 0.01 PI ($3,141.59) and verifies the Pi Coin's origin.

### 4. Simulate Blockchain Transaction
```python
import asyncio
from pi_coin import simulate_blockchain_transaction

asyncio.run(simulate_blockchain_transaction({"amount": 1.0, "source": "p2p"}))
```

For full examples, check `/pi_coin/examples/`.
